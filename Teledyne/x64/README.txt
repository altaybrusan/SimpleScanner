ArgusAPI 3.00 extra resource files
----------------------------------------------

A set of .dlls compiled for x64 platform are also included from API v3.0 ([installion_path]\x64) to facilitate user integration. Please do not use .dlls compiled for x64 bit on any 32-bit system. They will not be loaded by Windows 7 x64. Please also note: limited by existing TeledyneDalsa testing engineering toolsets, the x64 .dlls didn¡¯t go through as much as rigorous operational tests as their 32-bit counterpart. Please give your preference to the 32-bit .dlls whenever possible.
